<h4>what is a lasagna???</h4>
<p>This <strong>classic lasagna </strong>recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    <p><b>STEP 1</b>
To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over. </p>

<p><b>STEP 2</b> Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</p>
<P><B> STEP 3</B> Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</P>
<P><B>STEP 4</B> Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</P>
